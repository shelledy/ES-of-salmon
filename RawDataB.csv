(1950)","ESB: Rainbow trout and grayling
ESP: Eggs and blowflies
Sentence describing benefit: ""These salmon-derived resources represented not only an increase in food quantity, but also an increase in food quality because of the relatively high energy densities of salmon eggs and larval blowflies that feed on salmon carcasses (Table 1)."" (1950)","ESB: juvenile coho and steelhead
ESP: coho salmon carcasses
Sentence describing benefit: ""Bilby et al. (1998) demonstrated that the additions of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch Walbaum) carcasses to small streams in southwestern Washington led to increased density and body condition of juvenile coho and steelhead (O. mykiss), and that eggs and salmon flesh dominated the diets of those fish during the 1 month they were available.

(1951)","ESB: Freshwater ecosystems
ESP: Spawning salmon
Sentence describing benefit: ""This is very important because salmon are more than simple bags of nutrients, but rather serve as ecosystem engineers via the large disturbance of sediments and benthic invertebrates (Moore et al., 2004; Moore, 2006) while altering the foraging behaviour of stream fish (M.D. Scheuerell, J.W.

(1951)","ESB: fish
ESP: salmon carcasses, blowflies
Sentence describing benefit: ""terrestrial blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) will lay their eggs on carcasses stranded on gravel bars or the shoreline, with an average of 35 000 larval blowflies per sockeye salmon carcass typically devouring it within a week (Meehan, Seminet-Reneau & Quinn, 2005).

In many cases, chiefly managers gave permission for use of capture locations or gear and expected a share of the harvests in return for use (Swezey and Heizer 1977, Johnsen 2001, Trosper 2002, Haggan et al. 2006).""

Sentence describing benefit: ""Later in the year, usually in June–July at the peak of the summer run, another period of ritual and communal activities occurred, focusing on construction of large fish weirs on the Klamath and Trinity Rivers.

Construction of the weir at Kepel on the Klamath River by Yurok people, involved an elaborate 10-d ritual of weir building. Several hundred men from multiple villages were directed to cut wood and construct the elaborate structure. The Kepel weir had nine openings that led to pens in which salmon were held, then removed and dried mainly for later use. "" (np)","ESB: salmon via tribes

When the wild sea louse population shrinks relative to the farm population, resistance emerges faster (Murray 2011; McEwan et al. 2015).

Sentence describing benefit: ""Foraging bears facilitate salmon nutrient transfer to terrestrial habitats, as they pull live fish out of streams and leave their carcasses on land nearby (Hilderbrand et al. 1999; Quinn et al. 2009). Once a salmon carcass is abandoned by a bear, the remains become available to a suite of other species (e.g., insects and scavenging birds) that transfer nutrients (reviewed in Gende et al. 2002 and Janetski et al. 2009). These nutrients are also incorporated into surrounding plant matter (Hocking and Reynolds 2011; Hocking and Reynolds 2012) and can have impacts on local breeding bird communities (Christie and Reimchen 2008; Field and Reynolds 2011)."" (955)","ESB: riparian systems
ESP: bear-killed salmon
Sentence describing benefit: ""Carcasses left in the riparian zone are particularly important to nutrient transfer because they are less likely to be washed downstream into the estuary than the senescent salmon that die in the streams (Cederholm et al. 1989). Even bear-killed salmon abandoned within streams have more value, in nutrient terms, than senescent salmon carcasses, for certain species. For example, caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae preferentially colonize bear-killed salmon due to increased temporal availability, energetic content, and accessibility of tissue (Winder et al. 2005). The amount of salmon biomass abandoned by bears is, therefore, an important component to overall nutrient transfer to both terrestrial and aquatic pathways."" (955)","ESB: wolf

Sentence describing benefit: ""However, we detected significant increases in δ15N in G. satoi immediately downstream of the carcasses, which confirms the incorporation of carcass-derived N into the stream biota. The uptake of the N isotope into G. satoi was thought to have occurred as a result of the stable heavy isotope of N being released from salmon tissue and then being incorporated by microbes growing on the surfaces of leaves. This can produce higher microbial activity and the accretion of biomass associated with leaf material following nutrient enrichment.

For example, in a recent multi-decade fertilization experiment where salmon carcasses were moved by researchers into the forest along a 2 km stretch of one bank of a stream but not the other, long-term salmon carcass fertilization resulted in increased tree growth on the bank that was fertilized, though the effect was small compared to other factors (Quinn et al., 2018)."" (5","ESB: riparian ecosystems

Sentence describing benefit: ""Bear foraging on salmon increases marine nutrient retention in watersheds, which thus alters how plants access, use and compete for these resources.

While there is some evidence (Singh et al., 2015) that the eggs harbor their own microbes (likely on the surface), there is additional observational data showing that the internal/gut microbiome of feeding larvae change with the carcass resource microbial community, and indeed become more similar over time (Weatherbee et al., 2017).""

Sentence describing benefit: ""We found that salmon carcasses altered stream-riparian food webs by directly subsidizing multiple aquatic and terrestrial organisms (e.g., benthic insect larvae, fishes, and terrestrial flies). Such responses further influenced food webs along indirect pathways, some of which spanned land and water (e.g., subsidized fishes reduced aquatic insect emergence, with consequences for spiders and bats). Subsidy-mediated feedbacks manifested when carcasses were removed to riparian habitats where they were colonized by carrion flies, some of which fell into the stream and acted as another prey subsidy for fishes.""

The simple act of moving (i.e., as an output from the stream) carcasses to riparian areas increased carrion fly larvae and adults, many of which fell into streams and were consumed by fishes (Fig. 4c), and which contributed to enhanced fish growth rates (Collins et al. 2016).

ESP: salmon MDN
Sentence describing benefit: ""For example, riparian plants beside salmon streams have increased amounts of foliar 15N compared to those beside streams without salmon (Bilby et al. 1996, Bartz and Naiman 2005, Nagasaka et al. 2006)."" (2)","ESB: riparian plants
ESP: pink and chum
Sentence describing benefit: ""This study found a positive relationship between NDVI in summer months and the combined abundance of pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon among streams in the central coast of British Columbia (BC), Canada, as well as biennial increases in summer NDVI that corresponded with the two-year cycle of pink salmon returns to the lower Fraser River over an 18-yr time series. These results suggest that nutrient enrichment from pink and chum salmon positively influences riparian productivity in the summer after spawning and that this influence is detectable from space"" (3)","ESB: riparian forests
ESP: salmon MDN
Sentence describing benefit: ""Using the longest time series to date to test for effects of spawning salmon on forest productivity, our study provides evidence that riparian forests respond to cyclical pulses of salmon-derived nutrients and that this response can be identified with remotely sensed data."" (8)","ESB: forests
ESP: spawning salmon
Sentence describing benefit: ""We found that forests around the Adams River increase in greenness quadrennially in concert with the return of the dominant cohort of Adams River sockeye salmon"" (8)","ESB: forests
ESP: spawning sockeye
Sentence describing benefit: ""Across 36 yr at the Adams River, BC, we found that quadrennial pulses of sockeye salmon are associated with increased forest greenness during the subsequent summer growing season (i.e., 9–11 months after spawning). These pulses of sockeye do not increase forest greenness during or immediately after spawning in the fall; instead, these pulses are associated with increased greenness in the subsequent fall (i.e., 11–13 months after spawning)."" (8)","ESB: trees
ESP: salmon
Sentence describing benefit: ""They expected the trees located 50–90 m away and trees located upstream of spawning grounds to be unaffected by salmon but found that the effect of salmon on tree growth was even more positive among trees 50–90 m into the forest than among trees adjacent to spawning grounds."" (10)","ESB: riparian vegetation
ESP: sockeye salmon
Sentence describing benefit: "". In our study, during the summer, the greenness of plots located further away from the stream edge (approximately 95–125 m) was similarly associated with pulses of sockeye salmon abundance as was that of plots within 30 m of the stream edge"" (11)","ESB:
