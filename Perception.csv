Construction of a fish passage facility at Landsburg Diversion Dam on the Cedar River, WA, USA, provided a unique opportunity to explore this trade-off. We thoroughly sampled adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at the onset of colonization (2003–2009), constructed a pedigree from genotypes at 10 microsatellite loci, and calculated reproductive success (RS) as the total number of returning adult offspring. Hatchery males were consistently but not significantly less productive than naturally spawned males (range in relative RS: 0.70–0.90), but the pattern for females varied between years. The sex ratio was heavily biased toward males; therefore, inclusion of the hatchery males increased the risk of a genetic fitness cost with little demographic benefit. Measurements of natural selection indicated that larger salmon had higher RS than smaller fish. Fish that arrived early to the spawning grounds tended to be more productive than later fish, although in some years, RS was maximized at intermediate dates. Our results underscore the importance of natural and sexual selection in promoting adaptation during reintroductions."

(1989). The list includes 214 native naturally-spawning stocks: 101 at high risk of extinction, 58 at moderate risk of extinction, 54 of special concern, and one classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and as endangered by the state of California. The decline in native salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat populations has resulted from habitat loss and damage, and inadequate passage and flows caused by hydropower, agriculture, logging, and other developments; overfishing, primarily of weaker stocks in mixed-stock fisheries; and negative interactions with other fishes, including nonnative hatchery salmon and steelhead. While some attempts at remedying these threats have been made, they have not been enough to prevent the broad decline of stocks along the West Coast. A new paradigm that advances habitat restoration and ecosystem function rather than hatchery production is needed for many of these stocks to survive and prosper into the next century."

Large-scale hatchery programs for salmonids in the Pacific Northwest have largely failed to provide the anticipated benefits; rather than benefiting the salmon populations, these programs may pose the greatest single threat to the long-term maintenance of salmonids. Fisheries scientists, by promoting hatchery technology and giving hatchery tours, have misled the public into thinking that hatcheries are necessary and can truly compensate for habitat loss. I argue that hatchery programs that attempt to add additional fish to existing healthy wild stocks are ill advised and highly dangerous."

We used a questionnaire approach combined with spatial analysis to describe the status and distribution of stocks considered to be in relatively good condition. These stocks now constitute a small fraction of the region's historic anadromous salmonid resource but are critical to maintaining current resource productivity. Several agencies have developed, or are in the process of developing, computerized databases that will help organize predominantly quantitative data on native stocks of anadromous salmonids. Our survey supplements those efforts by summarizing some of the knowledge of biologists familiar with the stocks and by making status assessments that at times go beyond conservative analyses of quantitative data. The survey identified 99 healthy native wild stocks of salmon and steelhead that biologists consider to be at least one-third as abundant as would be expected without human impacts, including 20 considered at least two-thirds as abundant. More than three-quarters of these stocks are fall chinook, chum salmon, or winter steelhead in Puget Sound or coastal watersheds of Oregon or Washington. Fewer healthy populations remain of summer steelhead and coho, pink, and sockeye salmon and spring or summer chinook. We suggest that healthy stocks provide unique opportunities for conservation and research that are at least as important to the future of the region's anadromous salmonids as those associated with at-risk stocks."

The conservation benefit of captive rearing is that it bypasses the typically high smolt-to-adult mortality experienced by wild populations, but its success as a restoration strategy depends upon the ability of captively reared salmon to spawn and reproduce in natural streams. In an experimental channel, wild males dominated captively reared males of similar size in 86% of spawning events. Both wild and captively reared females attacked captively reared males more frequently than wild males, indicating a preference for wild over captively reared males, although the interplay between male dominance and Female mate choice was unclear. Wild females established nesting territories earlier and constructed more nests per individual than captively reared females of similar size, suggesting a competitive advantage for wild females. Nevertheless, captively reared coho salmon demonstrated the full range of behaviors shown by wild coho salmon of both sexes and the ability to spawn naturally.

Fisheries., 24(9), 16-23.",50,Authors propose an ecological risk assessment tool to help hatchery managers determine risk to non-target taxa.,Risk,"Oregon, USA","As wild fish populations continue to decline, fisheries managers are increasingly concerned about how hatchery operations might be contributing to declines of highly valued wild populations. Ecological risk assessments can provide decision makers with critical information about potential effects of stocking. In this paper we describe a practical approach for assessing ecological risks to select nontarget taxa (NTT) associated with fish stocking programs. This approach requires the completion of five tasks: (1) Determine acceptable impacts to NTT (e.g., impact of 10% to a species distribution, abundance, or size structure); (2) determine potential spatial-temporal overlap of NTT life stages with target taxon; (3) determine potential strong ecological interactions; (4) determine ecological risk; and (5) determine scientific uncertainty of ecological risk assessment. These tasks are accomplished by analyzing information gathered from scientists, managers, and policy makers. The result of the assessment is a listing of the ecological risks and associated uncertainties of failing to meet a stated objective for a variety of NTT. We also describe a decision matrix that prescribes various levels of uncertainty resolution, risk minimization strategies, risk containment monitoring, and stocking proposal implementation. Prescriptions reflect the amount of ecological risk and scientific uncertainty. Application of ecological risk assessment concepts to hatchery stocking decisions allows for a balanced approach when evaluating the benefits of hatchery stocking relative to ecological costs to nontarget populations and the economic costs of risk management."

Fisheries., 27(12), 10-15.",16,Authors suggest a framework for assessing and containing risks from salmon supplementation.,Risk,"Washington, USA","A temporal context to assess and contain ecological risks associated with salmon supplementation is described in this article. A successful supplementation program has at least four stages: Baseline, Broodstock, Building, and Boundary. These stages can be characterized by the number of target fish (e.g, the species supplemented) that spawn in the wild and hatchery. The type and strength of ecological interactions differ during the four stages of supplementation dynamics. During the Baseline stage, interactions between the naturally produced target species and non-target taxa (NTT) are likely to be relatively low because of the depressed abundance of the target species. During the Broodstock collection phase, interactions between naturally produced target fish and NTT are reduced but interactions between hatchery produced target fish and NTT are potentially high. Interactions with NTT are likely to be highest during the Building stage because of the high number of hatchery produced target fish released and the increased number of target fish produced in the natural environment. During the Boundary stage, only interactions between naturally produced target fish and NTT occur, but these interactions are likely to be more frequent than during the Baseline stage, particularly if the environmental capacity for NTT has not been improved in proportion to the increase in the target species. The temporal context described indicates that risk assessment and containment should address each of the stages of supplementation dynamics individually and collectively, the time-span of which could be between 10 and 40 years."

Such releases are performed worldwide in vast numbers. Augmentation can be demographically and economically beneficial but can also cause four types of adverse genetic change to wild populations: (1) loss of genetic variation, (2) loss of adaptations, (3) change of population composition, and (4) change of population structure. While adverse genetic impacts are recognized and documented in fisheries, little effort is devoted to actually monitoring them. In forestry and wildlife management, genetic risks associated with releases are largely neglected. We outline key features of programs to effectively monitor consequences of such releases on natural populations."

Efforts to mitigate severe losses to many wild stocks caused by overfishing, destruction of habitat, and blockage of migratory routes have focussed on boosting artificial production in public hatcheries. Opportunities for genetic interactions between hatchery and wild fish will increase if efforts to supplement wild production with hatchery-reared fish continue. Concerns center on three issues: (1) direct genetic effects (caused by hybridization and introgression); (2) indirect genetic effects (principally due to altered selection regimes or reductions in population size caused by competition, predation, disease, or other factors); and (3) genetic changes to hatchery stocks (through selection, drift, or stock transfers), which magnify the consequences of hybridization with wild fish. Strategies for minimizing these genetic risks and monitoring the consequences of various management options are discussed, and some important areas for future research are identified."
10,"Fraser, D. (2008). How well can captive breeding programs conserve biodiversity? A review of salmonids. Evolutionary Applications., 1(4), 535-586.",300,Review of demonstrated success/failure associated with captive breeding programs and theoretical recommendations.,Neutral,N/A,"Captive breeding programs are increasingly being initiated to prevent the imminent extinction of endangered species and/or populations. But how well can they conserve genetic diversity and fitness, or re-establish self-sustaining populations in the wild? A review of these complex questions and related issues in salmonid fishes reveals several insights and uncertainties. Most programs can maintain genetic diversity within populations over several generations, but available research suggests the loss of fitness in captivity can be rapid, its magnitude probably increasing with the duration in captivity. Over the long-term, there is likely tremendous variation between (i) programs in their capacity to maintain genetic diversity and fitness, and (ii) species or even intraspecific life-history types in both the severity and manner of fitness-costs accrued. Encouragingly, many new theoretical and methodological approaches now exist for current and future programs to potentially reduce these effects. Nevertheless, an unavoidable trade-off exists between conserving genetic diversity and fitness in certain instances, such as when captive-bred individuals are temporarily released into the wild. Owing to several confounding factors, there is also currently little evidence that captive-bred lines of salmonids can or cannot be reintroduced as self-sustaining populations. Most notably, the root causes of salmonid declines have not been mitigated where captive breeding programs exist. Little research has also addressed under what conditions an increase in population abundance due to captive-rearing might offset fitness reductions induced in captivity. Finally, more empirical investigation is needed to evaluate the genetic/fitness benefits and risks associated with (i) maintaining captive broodstocks as either single or multiple populations within one or more facilities, (ii) utilizing cryopreservation or surrogate broodstock technologies, and (iii) adopting other alternatives to captive-rearing such as translocations to new habitats. Management recommendations surrounding these issues are proposed, with the aim of facilitating meta-analyses and more general principles or guidelines for captive-breeding. These include the need for the following: (i) captive monitoring to involve, a priori, greater application of hypothesis testing through the use of well-designed experiments and (ii) improved documentation of procedures adopted by specific programs for reducing the loss of genetic diversity and fitness."

An evaluation of the effects of conservation and fishery enhancement hatcheries on wild populations of salmon. Advances in Marine Biology, 53, 61-194.",262,Authors review hatchery effectiveness and impact and recommend areas for further research or data standardization.,Neutral,N/A,"The historical, political and scientific aspects of salmon hatchery programmes designed to enhance fishery production, or to recover endangered populations, are reviewed. We start by pointing out that the establishment of hatcheries has been a political response to societal demands for harvest and conservation; given this social context, we then critically examined the levels of activity, the biological risks, and the economic analysis associated with salmon hatchery programmes. A rigorous analysis of the impacts of hatchery programmes was hindered by the lack of standardized data on release sizes and survival rates at all ecological scales, and since hatchery programme objectives are rarely defined, it was also difficult to measure their effectiveness at meeting release objectives. Debates on the genetic effects of hatchery programmes on wild fish have been dominated by whether correct management practices can reduce negative outcomes, but we noted that there has been an absence of programmatic research approaches addressing this important issue. Competitive interactions between hatchery and wild fish were observed to be complex, but studies researching approaches to reduce these interactions at all ecological scales during the entire salmon life history have been rare, and thus are not typically considered in hatchery management. Harvesting of salmon released from fishery enhancement hatcheries likely impacts vulnerable wild populations; managers have responded to this problem by mass marking hatchery fish, so that fishing effort can be directed towards hatchery populations. However, we noted that the effectiveness of this approach is dependant on accurate marking and production of hatchery fish with high survival rates, and it is not yet clear whether selective fishing will prevent overharvest of wild populations. Finally, research demonstrating disease transmission from hatchery fish to wild populations was observed to be equivocal; evidence in this area has been constrained by the lack of effective approaches to studying the fate of pathogens in the wild. We then reviewed several approaches to studying the economic consequences of hatchery activities intended to inform the social decisions surrounding programmes, but recognized that placing monetary value on conservation efforts or on hatcheries that mitigate cultural groups' loss of historical harvest opportunities may complicate these analyses. We noted that economic issues have rarely been included in decision making on hatchery programmes. We end by identifying existing major knowledge gaps, which, if filled, could contribute towards a fuller understanding of the role that hatchery programmes could play in meeting divergent goals. However, we also recognized that many management recommendations arising from such research may involve trade-offs between different risks, and that decisions about these trade-offs must occur within a social context. Hatcheries have played an important role in sustaining some highly endangered populations, and it is possible that reform of practices will lead to an increase in the number of successful programmes. However, a serious appraisal of the role of hatcheries in meeting broader needs is urgently warranted and should take place at the scientific, but more effectively, at the societal level."

The fanned salmon showed consistently higher levels of PCBs, PBDEs, OPs (except toxaphene) than the wild salmon. The mean concentrations in pg/g were 51,216 vs 5302 for total PCBs; 2668 vs 178 for total PBDEs; 41,796 vs 12,164 for total OPs (except toxaphene). The fanned salmon levels are likely a consequence of the elevated level of contamination found in the commercial salmon feed (mean concentrations in pg/g were 65,535 for total PCBs; 1889 for total BPDEs; 48,124 for total OPs except toxaphene). Except for a single high wild chinook value, PAHs were highest in the feed samples followed by the farmed fish and the three other wild fish. The Bio-Oregon-1996 feed of hatchery origin showed a level of PAHs ten times higher than any other feed. The genotoxic implications of such a high PAH level are considered for juvenile chinook salmon. Toxaphene and methyl mercury concentrations were not notably different between the wild and farmed salmon. There was no clear low contaminant brand of salmon feed. The human health implications of eating farmed salmon are considered from the perspective of the current WHO and Health Canada (2000) tolerable daily intake (TDI) values for PCBs. Based on a TDI of 1 pg TEQ/kg bw/day, this analysis indicated a safety concern for individuals who on a regular weekly basis consume farmed salmon produced from contaminated feed.

Journal of Fish Biology., 50(3), 634-651.",227,Authors study effects of hatchery escapements on native populations.,Risk,Norway,"There is concern that the progeny resulting from the spawnings of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon may compete with and disrupt native salmon populations. This study compared, both in the hatchery and in the wild, fitness-related traits and examined interactions among farmed, native and hybrid 0(+) parr derived from controlled crosses and reared under common conditions. The farmed salmon were seventh-generation fish from the principal commercial strain in Norway and native salmon were from the rivers Imsa and Lone, Norway. In the hatchery, farmed salmon were more aggressive than both native populations and tended to dominate them in pairwise contests. Farmed salmon were also more prone to risk, leaving cover sooner after a simulated predator attack, and had higher growth rates than native fish. Interbreeding between farmed and native fish generally resulted in intermediate expression of the above traits. There was, however, evidence of hybrid vigour in Lone/farmed crosses which were able to dominate both pure Lone and farmed parr in pairwise contests. In the wild, observations of habitat use and diet suggested that the populations compete for territory and food, and both farmed fish and hybrids expressed higher growth rates than native fish. Our results suggest that these innate differences in behaviour and growth, that probably are linked closely to fitness, will threaten native populations through competition and disruption of local adaptations.

We review the differences reported, designs appropriate for testing different hypotheses about competition, and tests of competition reported in the literature. Many studies have provided circumstantial evidence for competition, but the effects of competition were confounded with other variables. Most direct experiments of competition used additive designs that compared treatments in which hatchery fish were introduced into habitats containing wild fish with controls without hatchery fish. These studies are appropriate for quantifying the effects of hatchery fish at specific combinations of fish densities and stream carrying capacity. However, they do not measure the relative competitive ability of hatchery versus wild fish because the competitive ability of hatchery fish is confounded with the increased density that they cause. We are aware of only two published studies that used substitutive experimental designs in which density was held equal among treatments, thereby testing for differences in competitive ability. Additional substitutive experiments will help managers to better understand the ecological risk of stocking hatchery fish."

We compared a seventh-generation strain of farmed Atlantic salmon from Sunndalsora, Norway, with its principal founder population from the wild, the River Namsen. The fish were reared from eggs in a common environment and assessed for the extent of genetic divergence in several fitness-related traits. Morphology had diverged, as farmed juveniles showed more robust bodies and smaller rayed fins than the wild juveniles. Ecologically important aspects of behaviour also differed. Farmed juveniles were more aggressive in a tank environment typical of culture facilities, while wild juveniles dominated in a stream-like environment. Farmed juveniles were also more risk-prone, reappearing from cover sooner after a simulated predator attack. It was not surprising that growth performance was higher in farmed than wild juveniles, as the former had been subjected to intentional selection for this trait. Correlated responses to this selection may also explain the higher rate of smelting and lower rate of male parr maturity in the farmed than the wild salmon. Competition with wild juveniles, however, negatively affected the growth of the farmed juveniles, particularly under semi-natural conditions. Our results indicate that fanning of Atlantic salmon generates rapid genetic change, as a result of both intentional and unintentional selection in culture, that alters important fitness-related traits."

This issue takes on great importance in the Pacific Northwest where supplementation of wild salmon populations with hatchery fish has been identified as an important tool for restoring these populations.

These myths impede productive dialogue among those with differing views about hatcheries. Most of the myths include a measure of truth, which makes it difficult to recognize the elements that are not true. Consideration of these myths leads to the following conclusions: (1) Hatcheries are intrinsically neither good nor bad-their value can be determined only in the context of clearly defined goals; (2) genetic changes in cultured populations can be reduced but not eliminated entirely; (3) empirical evidence exists of many adverse effects of hatcheries, but some risks have been overstated; and ( 1) monitoring and evaluation programs are important but should not be used as a substitute For developing risk-averse hatchery programs in the first place. A key step in resolving some of the controversies will be moving toward agreement on a common version (rather than two or more separate versions) of the realities about hatcheries.

We reviewed over 100 facilities and 200 programs and identified three principles of hatchery reform: (1) goals for each program must be explicitly stated in terms of desired benefits and purposes; (2) programs must be scientifically defensible; and (3) hatchery programs must respond adaptively to new information. We also identified several emerging issues critical to the success of hatcheries. We concluded that hatcheries must operate in new modes with increased scientific oversight and that they cannot meet their goals without healthy habitats and self-sustaining, naturally-spawning populations."

To ensure that the greatest benefit from a stocking programme is realised, stocking rates should be optimal for the type of habitat being stocked. How this can be determined is presented together with guidelines for stocking different types of habitat. Benefit, in terms of cost of adult return or per adult fish caught, enables comparisons to be made with other management options.

Recent successes in salmon stock enhancement are attributed to improvement of the return rate resulting from physiological and behavioral research. In scallop stock enhancement, high quality of seedlings, improvement of the environment, crop rotation, and the marketing system have supported a steady yearly increase in yield. Flounder stock enhancement in Fukushima Prefecture has achieved a 30% recapture rate, and the cost-benefit ratio is estimated to be more than 300%. In the case of red sea bream, because recreational anglers now catch a higher percentage of stocked fish than do commercial fishermen, a new method of fisheries regulation may be required, as recreational anglers now pay only little of the casts of the stocking program. Masu salmon and abalone stocks are best preserved by the protection of spawning grounds. In marine ranching of striped jack, understanding of behavioral ecology seems to be essential for the success of this project and the prevention of genetic pollution. Behavioral quality of stocked fish is a determining factor in the success of stock enhancement, so attempts have been made to improve behavioral quality in several species. Although sea farming projects have been well supported by basic research on diet, physiology, morphology, and behavior, the present authors believe that ecological research in the natural habitat of each species is indispensable for the success of stock enhancement and that the national and prefectural governments should take the initiative in protection of genetic diversity."

We repeated the analyses using a longer time period containing both ""good"" and ""bad"". ocean conditions (1965-2000) as a first step toward determining whether recent apparent declines are a result of sampling a period of poor ocean conditions. All the listed ESUs except Columbia River chum showed declining trends with estimated long-term population growth rates (X's) ranging from 0.85 to 1.0, under the, assumption that hatchery fish were not reproducing and not masking the true X. If hatchery fish were reproducing, the estimated X's fanged from 0.62 to 0.89, indicating extremely low natural reproduction and survival. For most ESUs, there was no significant decline in population growth rates calculated for. the 1980-2000 Vs. 1965-2000 time periods, suggesting that the current population status for most ESUs is not solely. a result of changes in ocean conditions, and that without other changes, risks will persist even during upturns in ocean conditions. However, estimated population growth rates for the Snake River spring-summer chinook salmon and steelhead ESUs were significantly lower during the longer time period. This difference may be due to a period of dam building on the Snake River during the 1960s and 1970s. For 33 stocks and seven ESUs, the probability of extinction could be estimated. The estimates were generally low for all ESUs with the exception of Upper Columbia River spring chinook and Upper Willamette River steelhead. The probability of 90% decline could be estimated for all stocks. The mean probability of 90% decline in 50 years was highest for Upper Columbia River spring chinook (95% mean probability across all stocks within the ESU) and Lower Columbia River steelhead (80% mean probability). We estimated the effects of two different management actions on long-term growth rates for the ESUs. Harvest reductions offer a means to mitigate risks for ESUs that bear substantial harvest pressure, but they are unlikely to increase population growth rates enough to produce stable or increasing trends for all ESUs. Similarly, anticipated improvements to passage survival through the Snake and mainstem Columbia hydropower systems may be important, but additional actions are likely to be necessary to recover affected ESUs."

Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries., 13(4), 409-432.",111,Decision making tool for stock enhancement,Neutral,Australia,"Stock enhancement has been viewed as a positive fisheries management tool for over 100 years. However, decisions to undertake such activities in the past have often been technology-based, i.e., driven by the ability to produce fishes, with most stock enhancement projects having limited or no demonstrated success. The reasons for this have been due to an inability to identify and/or control the underlying reasons why a fishery is under-performing or not meeting management objectives. Further, stock enhancement has often been applied in isolation from other fisheries management tools ( e. g., effort control). To address these issues and consider stock enhancement in a broader ecosystem perspective, a new approach for stock enhancement is proposed. The proposed model comprises four major steps; a review of all information about an ecosystem/fishery/stock and the setting of clear management targets; a comparison of all relevant fisheries management tools with the potential to meet the management targets; the instigation of a scientifically based, pilot-scale, stock enhancement program with clear objectives, targets, and evaluations; and a full-scale stock enhancement program if the pilot project meets the objectives. The model uses a flow-chart that highlights a broad range of scientific and other information, and the decisions that need to be made in relation to stock enhancement and fisheries management in general. In this way all steps are transparent and all stakeholders ( managers, scientists, extractive and non-extractive users, and the general public) can contribute to the information collection and decision making processes. If stock enhancement is subsequently identified as the most-appropriate tool, then the stepwise progression will provide the best possible chance of a positive outcome for a stock enhancement project, while minimizing risks and costs. In this way, stock enhancement may advance as a science and develop as a useful fisheries management tool in appropriate situations."

On the United States Atlantic Coast, where diadromous fish populations have undergone dramatic declines, restoration programs based on fishway construction and hatcheries have sustained remnant populations, but large-scale restoration has not been achieved. We examine anadromous fish restoration programs on three large Atlantic Coast rivers, the Susquehanna, Connecticut, and Merrimack with multiple mainstem hydropower dams, most with relatively low generating capacity. Mean passage efficiencies through fishways on these rivers from the first dam to the spawning grounds for American shad are less than 3%. The result is that only small fractions of targeted fish species are able to complete migrations. It may be time to admit failure of fish passage and hatchery-based restoration programs and acknowledge that significant diadromous species restoration is not possible without dam removals. The approach being employed on the Penobscot River, where dams are being removed or provided the opportunity to increase power generation within a plan to provide increased access to habitat, offers a good model for restoration. Dammed Atlantic Coastal rivers offer a cautionary tale for developing nations intent on hydropower development, suggesting that lasting ecosystem-wide impacts cannot be compensated for through fish passage and hatchery technology."

The distribution of potential exposure factors associated with the site management and location was compared in 2 paired groups of sea sites, one group comprising 37 ISA-positive sites and the other 37 ISA-negative sites. The risk of ISA was found to be significantly associated with the location of the site. Location within 5 km from a salmonid slaughterhouse gave an ISA odds ratio of 13.0 compared to location further away. The risk of infection increased by 8.0 if the site was situated closer than 5 km to another ISA-positive site as compared to the risk when the site was more than 5 km away. Disinfecting the waste water from the slaughtering and processing plants seemed to prevent transmission of ISA. The density of fish markets for sea-caught fish was higher in the vicinity of cases than of controls. The risk of ISA was associated with the number of hatcheries delivering smelt to the sea sites, and the risk increased if the hatcheries were located outside the site's home county. The overall results from the present study indicate that ISA is mainly transmitted from infected salmonid sources to clean sites through sea water. Further disease control measures should concentrate on minimising the risk of transmission through sea water by shortening the time period between the diagnosis of ISA and the elimination of positive sites, and should work towards the establishment of 5 km as a minimum distance between sea sites. In addition, decontamination systems must be systematically introduced into the fish processing industry. The implementation of good sanitary practices by fish farmers may also reduce the risk of ISA."

Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries., 19(1), 9-31.",91,Review of factors contributing to ecological risks from hatchery released fish.,Risk,USA,"State and federal agencies in the United States annually release millions of hatchery salmon and steelhead into public waters. Many of the hatchery programs are located in areas where the wild populations are now listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. A A A 1531-1544). These hatchery programs pose genetic and ecological risks to wild fish populations. Genetic risks occur when hatchery and wild fish interbreed and usually occur within a taxonomic species. Ecological risks occur when the presence of hatchery fish affects how wild fish interact with their environment or with other species and may affect whole species assemblages. This paper reviews some of the factors that contribute to ecological risks. Important contributing factors include the relative abundance of hatchery and wild fish in natural production areas, hatchery programs that increase density-dependant mortality, residual hatchery fish, some physical advantages that hatchery fish can have over wild fish, and life history characteristics that may make some species especially vulnerable to the effects of ecological risks. Many of these risk factors can be mitigated by management activities that reduce the level of interactions between hatchery and wild fish. This paper concludes by recommending twelve mitigation strategies that may be useful when agencies need to bring hatchery programs into compliance with the take provisions of the ESA."

After a brief description of the methods of captive breeding and the establishment of breeding stocks, this paper provides examples of the application of these techniques to endemic fish species of arid regions in south-western USA and examines some current cases and the future possibilities for their use in the Mediterranean region. Special attention is given to the analysis of the strict constraints imposed on fish breeding for conservation purposes, in which the aim is to produce fish with all the morphological, behavioural and genetic characteristics of the taxa to be conserved, and which are capable of effectively adapting to the natural environment when introduced. In terms of genetic management of captive populations, the fundamental problems which are faced involve the categorization of the species-resources to be conserved (identification of cases of inter- and intra-specific introgression), the establishment of founder stocks that contain the maximum genetic diversity depending on the genetic structure of the species (strong intra- or interpopulation variability), and the retention of genetic variability during captive breeding (the need to reduce to the minimum the phenomena of genetic drift, inbreeding and unintentional selection of non-adapted genotypes). Because of these difficulties and risks in terms of genetic conservation, captive breeding should remain a temporary safeguard measure, while awaiting the implementation of measures for protecting species in their restored original habitat or translocation to strictly protected substitute habitats. With this aim in view and in conclusion, the paper suggests methods for organizing a critical plan to safeguard the most endangered species or subspecies in the Mediterranean region by captive breeding."

Biological Conservation, 144(7), 1972-1979.",77,Experimental comparison of fish behavior between rearing conditions.,Neutral,United Kingdom,"Hatcheries often produce bold fish that are maladapted to survive in the wild, as absence of predators and selection for fast growth tend to favour risk-taking behaviors. Not surprisingly, losses of hatchery fish through predation can be high immediately after release and this may account for the failure of many ex-situ fish conservation programmes. For supportive-breeding to be useful, it is essential that released fish are able to display natural behaviors. We compared the performance of juvenile Atlantic salmon reared in environmentally-enriched tanks receiving natural prey and subjected to simulated predator attacks with fish reared under standard hatchery conditions while keeping densities constant. No differences were detected between controls and environmentally enriched fish in survival, final size or nutritional status. Yet, changes in rearing conditions had rapid and marked effects on risk-taking behavior. Environmentally enriched fish were 2.1 times less willing, and took significantly longer to leave shelter, than controls within two weeks of enrichment. Thus our study indicates that it is possible through environmental enrichment to modify at least one component of fishes’ behavior known to have clear adaptive implications, i.e. the propensity of hatchery-reared fish to take excessive risks. Ex-situ conservation could therefore benefit from rearing fish in naturalized, structurally complex environments with natural prey to promote the development of more natural behaviors."

Typically, model predictions are extremely sensitive to estimated parameters, resulting in risk estimates that are very imprecise. Therefore, careful consideration of uncertainty is warranted when reporting PVA predictions. Here, we survey some simple and general simulation-based methods for assessing the uncertainty in model-based forecasts. We then illustrate how these methods can be used for incorporating parameter uncertainty when reporting estimates of extinction risk, using a PVA model developed from data on Pacific Chinook salmon stocks. Several researchers have suggested that relative assessments between management options will be more stable than estimates of extinction risk and population growth rate. We illustrate how the uncertainty in relative assessments can be quantified in a rigorous way. Finally, we show how Sobol' indices can be used to ask: ""Where is the uncertainty coming from?"" These indices are an ANOVA-like decomposition of the effects of parameters on model output that take into account both direct effects (as in standard sensitivity analysis) and effects due to interactions with other parameters. Throughout, we illustrate these methods using models relevant to the life cycle of Pacific salmon, with the intent of assessing the relative influences of habitat, harvest, and hatcheries on the viability of salmon populations. However, the same approaches are applicable to most situations where a model with estimated parameters is being used for forecasting or comparing management options."

ICES Journal of Marine Science., 54(6), 1031-1039.",75,Behavioral comparison between wild and cultured Atlantic salmon.,Neutral,Norway,"Cultured Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) may be introduced into natural systems intentionally or accidentally. As smelts or post-smelts, they move to the feeding areas of wild salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean. As maturing fish, they return to the area of release and enter rivers to spawn. Lack of juvenile river experience is the prime reason why cultured salmon often enter fresh water later in the season than wild fish. During spawning, cultured female salmon from fish farms make fewer nests, tend to breed for a shorter period of time, are poorer at nest covering, and retain greater amounts of unspawned eggs than wild females. Cultured male salmon from fish farms exhibit less combat and display behaviour, have greater difficulty in acquiring access to mates, show less quivering and courting behaviour, and have lower reproductive success than wild males. However, cultured male salmon are more involved in prolonged, reciprocal fights than wild males and are, therefore, more often wounded. The reproductive success of cultured salmon increases with the time the fish have lived in nature before maturing sexually; for cultured females released in nature at the smelt stage, reproductive success is similar to that of wild females. The relative reproductive success of cultured males is smaller than that of corresponding females. Within both sexes of cultured and wild salmon, competitive spawning ability increases with body size. As a phenotypic response to increased growth rate during the first year of life, cultured salmon tend to have smaller sized but more numerous eggs than wild fish of the same size. Offspring of cultured salmon are more generally aggressive, more risk prone, and have a higher growth rate than wild offspring. Consequently, their survival rate in nature may be lower.

Displacement rearing occurs if part of the rearing and release strategy occurs at a foreign drainage or includes the marine environment. We compared straying between non-displacement and three types of displacement releases where: (1) juveniles are transported, reared in a central hatchery and released back into natal drainage (satellite); (2) or transported, reared in a central or recipient hatchery and released in a foreign drainage (transplant); (3) or reared and released directly into the marine environment away from the home drainage (out-estuary). Compared with non-displacement oaring, displacement-reared fish were between two and five times more likely to stray (2.1-5.3% vs 1.2%). Out-estuary releases had the highest stray rates of the displacement rearing types and were suspected of being least successful at imprinting on the home stream, Analysis of hybrid and transplanted stocks suggested that there was a genetic component to homing. A hybrid stock was three times more likely to stray than the natal stock released at the same time and location (6.2% vs 2.4%). Transplanted fish without exposure to their ancestral drainage were more Likely to stray back to the ancestral drainage than non-transplanted fish released at the same time and location (2.9% vs 0.1%).

At the end of the 4-year project, the cause of M74 is still not known, but the symptoms have been well described and treatment with thiamine (vitamin B-1) has been found to cure afflicted fry. The M74 syndrome shows great similarities to Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS) in salmonids from the North American Great Lakes. Both M74 and EMS are characterized by a diet-related deficiency of thiamine in fry and broodstocks. A combination of factors may contribute to M74, e.g. the diet of salmon in the Baltic Sea, the content of thiamine or thiaminase (an enzyme that degrades thiamine) in their prey fish, ecological changes in Baltic Sea food chains, and pollutants. The few remaining wild, naturally spawning populations of Baltic salmon are at great risk of extinction, as there is no practical method of treating them with thiamine to prevent M74, and they are subject to heavy fishing pressure in the Baltic Sea. A reproductive disturbance similar to M74 occurs in Baltic sea trout (S. trutta), although at lower frequencies than in salmon. The M74 syndrome does not occur in Baltic cod (Gadus morhua), whose reproductive success is impaired mainly by poor oxygen conditions in its deepwater spawning grounds, in combination with heavy fishing pressure on large cod."

This concern has arisen mainly from research on laboratory-reared animals and theoretical modeling exercises. In this study, we used biocontained naturalized stream environments and conventional hatchery environments to show that differences in phenotype between transgenic and wild genotypes depend on rearing conditions and, critically, that such genotype-by-environment interactions may influence subsequent ecological effects in nature. Genetically wild and growth hormone transgenic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were reared from the fry stage under either standard hatchery conditions or under naturalized stream conditions. When reared under standard hatchery conditions, the transgenic fish grew almost three times longer than wild conspecifics and had (under simulated natural conditions) stronger predation effects on prey than wild genotypes (even after compensation for size differences). In contrast, when fish were reared under naturalized stream conditions, transgenic fish were only 20% longer than the wild fish, and the magnitude of difference in relative predation effects was much reduced. These data show that genotype-by-environment interactions can influence the relative phenotype of transgenic and wild-type organisms and that extrapolations of ecological consequences from phenotypes developed in the unnatural laboratory environment may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of ecological risk. Thus, for transgenic organisms that may not be released to nature, the establishment of a range of highly naturalized environments will be critical for acquiring reliable experimental data to be used in risk assessments."

One would therefore expect growth rates under natural conditions to be close to an evolutionary optimum. Nevertheless, natural selection in many salmonid species appears to be toward larger size and earlier emergence from spawning redds, indicating a potential for increased growth rate to evolve. We tested how selection for genetic variants (growth hormone transgenic coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, with more than doubled daily growth rate potential relative to wild genotypes) depended on predator timing and food abundance during the early period of life (fry stage). In artificial redds, fry of the fast-growing genotypes showed a highly significant developmental shift, emerging from gravel nests approximately two weeks sooner, but with an 18.6% reduced survival, relative to wild-genotype fry. In seminatural streams, fry of the fast-growing genotypes suffered higher predation than those of wild genotypes when predators were present at the time of fry emergence, but this difference was less pronounced when food was scarce. In streams where predators were introduced after emergence, fry survived equally well regardless of food availability. Surviving fry grew faster in habitats provided with more food, and fast-growing genotypes also grew faster than Wild genotypes when predators arrived late and food was abundant. Fewer fish migrated downstream past a waterfall when food availability was high and in the presence of predators, and wild-genotype fry were more likely to migrate than fry of the fast-growing genotypes. After being returned to the experimental streams after migration, fast-growing genotypes survived equally well as those of the same genotypes that did not migrate, whereas migrating wild genotypes experienced higher mortality relative to those of the same genotypes that did not migrate. Comparisons of growth rates between siblings retained under hatchery conditions and those from habitats with the fastest growth in the experimental stream revealed that growth rates were similar for wild genotypes in both environments, whereas the fast-growing genotypes in the streams only realized 90% of their growth potential. The present study has shown that a major shift in developmental timing can alter critical early stages affecting survival and can have a significant effect on fitness. Furthermore, ecological conditions such as food abundance and predation pressure can strongly influence the potential for fast-growing variants to survive under natural conditions. The large-scale removal of many predatory species around the world may augment the evolution of increased intrinsic growth rates in some taxa."

There is particular concern for populations of wild coho because, in addition to low abundance, up to 80% of the juvenile coho in the coastal waters has been identified as being produced by enhancement projects. The most likely reasons for the decline in Pacific salmon stocks include a combination of climate change, overfishing, and freshwater habitat destruction. There have also been suggestions that salmon farming in British Columbia has contributed to the decline of salmon stocks. The hypothesized effects of salmon farming include potential ecological interactions as well as disease concerns. In this paper, we consider the effects of climate change on the abundance of wild salmon stocks as well as potential genetic, ecological, and disease concerns. Shifts in climate in 1977 and 1989 resulted in significant changes in production for a number of marine fish species including Pacific salmon. These climate-related changes, combined with local overfishing and the loss of freshwater habitat, have left some salmon stocks at very low levels. Large-scale salmon enhancement projects have also resulted in significant ecological and genetic interactions with wild salmon, particularly for coho and chinook stocks. These interactions have tended to reduce genetic diversity and result in the replacement of wild salmon by hatchery fish. Hatcheries also represent a potential source of disease pathogens although the magnitude of the problem is difficult to quantify because the disease agents of concern are widespread in both wild and hatchery Pacific salmon as well as a number of non-salmonid hosts. In addition, the same antibiotics used in the salmon farming industry are also used in salmon enhancement projects, making it difficult to identify the source of some pathogens. Although farmed salmon are also a potential source for these disease pathogens, surveys of pathogens in wild and hatchery fish show no patterns that could be attributed to salmon fanning. Recent improvements in fish husbandry, including the development and widespread use of vaccines, have also reduced the risk of disease transfer from farmed fish to wild or hatchery fish. The combined evidence indicates that salmon farming, as currently practiced in British Columbia, poses a low risk to wild salmon stocks particularly when compared to other potential factors.

However, the manner in which these programs are implemented can have significant impacts on the evolutionary trajectory and long-term viability of populations. In this paper, we review the potential benefits and risks of hatchery programs relative to the conservation of species listed under the US Endangered Species Act. To illustrate, we present the range of potential effects within a population as well as among populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) where changes to major hatchery programs are being considered. We apply evolutionary considerations emerging from these examples to suggest broader principles for hatchery uses that are consistent with conservation goals. We conclude that because of the evolutionary risks posed by artificial propagation programs, they should not be viewed as a substitute for addressing other limiting factors that prevent achieving viability. At the population level, artificial propagation programs that are implemented as a short-term approach to avoid imminent extinction are more likely to achieve long-term population viability than approaches that rely on long-term supplementation. In addition, artificial propagation programs can have out-of-population impacts that should be considered in conservation planning."

Variance in competitive ability among males should lead to a corresponding skew in reproductive success. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) males form dominance hierarchies during spawning, such that the dominant individuals are predicted to realize the highest reproductive success. However, the degree to which this occurs depends on various genetic and environmental factors. 2. We investigated the influence of the aquaculture environment on male Atlantic salmon behaviour during spawning in three experiments involving groups of either purely farmed or wild males, or mixed groups composed of equal numbers of farmed and wild fish. The objective of this study was to compare and contrast the formation of dominance hierarchies and relationships between aggression, courtship and spawning success in farmed and wild males. 3. Although farmed males did not establish dominance hierarchies as effectively as wild males, they courted and spawned with females in larger numbers and they frequently failed to release sperm when females released eggs. 4. Dominance structures established by wild males led to reliable behavioural correlates of spawning success; this was not the case among farmed males. 5. From the risk-assessment perspective, farmed males can be expected to have reduced spawning success, although the degree of reproductive inferiority of farmed relative to wild males depends upon rearing environment and the populations under consideration."

By holding male density constant and varying the frequency of adults and jacks in eight separate breeding groups, we found that adult male access to females, participation in spawning events, and adult-to-fry reproductive success increased with their decreasing frequency in a breeding group. Jacks exhibited the same pattern (increasing success with decreasing frequency), although the relationships were not as strong as for adults. Overall, jack and adult males mated with a similar number of females, but jacks sired only 20% of all offspring. Observational data suggested that adult males benefited from sperm precedence associated with their ability to court females and enter the nest first at the time of spawning.

In addition to the development of hatchery technologies, several possible hypotheses may explain these catch trends, including climate change, closing of hi-h-seas fisheries, rehabilitation of water quality, habitat loss caused by damming and channelling, and increased pressure from recreational fisheries. Even when these other factors have been accounted for, it is difficult to evaluate whether all hatchery programmes have actually increased net populations. To use these programmes more effectively, it is necessary to evaluate both their river- and species-specific benefits and compare hatchery programmes with other management tools, such as fishery controls and habitat rehabilitation. Future hatchery programmes should incorporate active, adaptive learning approaches to minimize the risks associated with artificial propagation and to promote sustainable salmon stocks."

Instead of habituating to predator odours, the fish conditioned repeatedly (four times) improved their spatial avoidance of predator cues in the course of training. The repeated conditioning also further enhanced the survival of the test fish as compared to the singly conditioned fish. The economical and ethical advantages of training with chemical cues, combined with its high reliability, could promote the success of fish reintroductions especially through repeated antipredator conditioning.

Two species are currently being farmed in North Atlantic countries, ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) and lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus), and the sector in most countries is rapidly expanding towards self-sufficiency. The species are very different both in terms of their biology and life histories and, consequently, production and husbandry methods must be tailored to each species. There are numerous health challenges currently experienced in both species, with bacterial and parasitic diseases being the most prevalent, and cohabitation with salmon may increase the risk of disease. Good husbandry and routine health monitoring are essential, although treatment is often required when disease outbreaks occur. Ballan wrasse and lumpfish are both proven to be effective salmon delousers, although delousing efficacy can be variable in farmed fish; the provision of suitable habitat and acclimation to net-pen conditions may encourage natural behaviours, including delousing, and the use of operational welfare indicators can highlight potential welfare issues. Cleaner fish research is progressing rapidly, although much of the basic knowledge regarding the species' biology remains unknown. The simultaneous domestication of two new marine aquaculture species is a significant challenge demanding sustained effort and funding over a prolonged period of time. Research must focus on enhancing the robustness of the farmed stocks and increasing hatchery outputs to meet the urgent demands from the salmon sector and protect wild stocks from overfishing."

We examined adult morphological phenotypes, gamete quantity and quality, in vitro offspring production, courtship and spawning behavior, male competitive behavior, and transgene transmission to offspring. Transgenic, hatchery, and cultured nontransgenic fish required 2, 3, and 3 or 4 years, respectively, to reach sexual maturation. No differences in male gamete quantity or in vitro offspring production were observed. Transgenic females were more fecund than hatchery females but had smaller eggs. Fewer transgenic females spawned than hatchery females under experimental conditions, and transgenic females displayed consistently low levels of courtship behavior. In noncompetitive trials, there were no differences in the courtship behavior of transgenic and hatchery males; during competition with hatchery males, however, transgenic males failed to spawn and displayed less courtship and competitive behavior. Cultured nontransgenic salmon also displayed reduced spawning capacity relative to hatchery salmon, indicating that the effects observed in transgenic salmon may arise in part from being reared in the culture environment and highlighting the difficulty in using laboratory-reared transgenic fish to assess reproductive fitness because of the strong genotype-environment interactions. As long as wild-reared transgenic fish are unavailable, exact determinations of reproductive fitness will be difficult. However, these studies have shown that in a simulated natural environment, growth-enhanced transgenic coho salmon do display courtship behavior and can spawn, producing viable transgenic offspring. The findings suggest some capacity exists for the natural transmission of transgenes to populations arising from reproductive interaction, which could occur during first contact between escaped cultured transgenic fish and wild conspecifics."

We provide genetic evidence based on mtDNA and microsatellite markers, using mixed-stock analysis, that a large proportion (66%) of fin-damaged spawners (n=181) caught in the Ume/Vindelalven during 1997-2003 originated from the hatcheries in the Rivers Angermanalven, Lulealven and Ljusnan. The maximum-likelihood estimate of immigration rate from these hatcheries into the wild Vindelalven population was 0.068 (95% CI 0.021-0.128) over the studied time period (1985-2003) and reached up to a quarter (m=0.249, 95% CI 0.106-0.419) of the total population during 1993-2000. This resulted in significant (P<0.01) genetic homogenization trend between the wild Vindelalven population and hatchery stocks of the Angermanalven and Lulealven.

In contrast to less populous species of salmon, these species are more abundant now than ever, averaging 665x10(6) adult salmon each year (1.32x10(6)metric tons) during 1990-2015. When immature salmon are included, recent biomass estimates approach 5x10(6)metric tons. Following an initial peak during 1934-1943, abundances were low until the 1977 regime shift benefited each species. During 1990-2015, Pink Salmon dominated adult abundance (67% of total) and biomass (48%), followed by Chum Salmon (20%, 35%) and Sockeye Salmon (13%, 17%). Alaska produced approximately 39% of all Pink Salmon, 22% of Chum Salmon, and 69% of Sockeye Salmon, while Japan and Russia produced most of the remainder. Although production of natural-origin salmon is currently high due to generally favorable ocean conditions in northern regions, approximately 60% of Chum Salmon, 15% of Pink Salmon, and 4% of Sockeye Salmon during 1990-2015 were of hatchery origin. Alaska generated 68% and 95% of hatchery Pink Salmon and Sockeye Salmon, respectively, while Japan produced 75% of hatchery Chum Salmon. Salmon abundance in large areas of Alaska (Prince William Sound and Southeast Alaska), Russia (Sakhalin and Kuril islands), Japan, and South Korea are dominated by hatchery salmon. During 1990-2015, hatchery salmon represented approximately 40% of the total biomass of adult and immature salmon in the ocean. Density-dependent effects are apparent, and carrying capacity may have been reached in recent decades, but interaction effects between hatchery- and natural-origin salmon are difficult to quantify, in part because these fish are rarely separated in catch and escapement statistics. The following management changes are recommended: (1) mark or tag hatchery salmon so that they can be identified after release, (2) estimate hatchery- and natural-origin salmon in catches and escapement, and (3) maintain these statistics in publicly accessible databases."

This mixed-milt approach leads to significant sperm competition and highly unequal genetic contributions from male spawners. Sperm competition substantially reduces the genetic effective number of breeders (N-b) relative to the actual number of spawners (N-x). Sperm competition in vitro can also result in undesirable artificial selection for life history traits (e.g., age or size at maturity) that are correlated phenotypically with sperm potency and fertilization success. A large number of salmon hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest, particularly those within some state agencies, continue to use mixed-milt fertilization despite documented genetic effects and potential risks. The continued use of mixed-milt fertilization may be due, in part, to insufficient genetic oversight of hatchery operations. As a general rule, salmon hatcheries should discontinue mixed-milt fertilization and institutionalize alternative spawning protocols that preclude or minimize sperm competition in vitro. Three alternative protocols are described here: pairwise spawning, nested spawning, and factorial or matrix spawning. The underlying premise of these alternative protocols is that every adult selected for use as broodstock should have an equal opportunity-and an equal probability-of producing progeny. A goal of most hatchery programs should be to minimize genetic change between the pool of returning adults available for broodstock each year and the progeny of parents selected as broodstock from that pool. To achieve this goal, spawning protocols should maximize N-b and minimize artificial selection associated with hatchery propagation. Such goals may require increased genetic oversight of hatchery operations comparable to the level of fish health oversight (pathogen monitoring and disease prevention) currently practiced in salmon hatcheries throughout the Pacific Northwest."

Because climatic conditions can influence salmon survival, we included an index of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a covariate in our analyses. Based on time series of hatchery releases and rates of smolt-to-adult survival, we demonstrate that the survival of wild chinook salmon is negatively associated with hatchery releases of steelhead. The state of the ( ENSO) did not affect the strength of this relationship. We observed no relationship between survival of wild steelhead and steelhead hatchery releases. Our results suggest that industrial-scale production of hatchery fish may hinder the recovery of some threatened salmonids and that the potential interspecific impact of hatcheries must be considered as agencies begin the process of hatchery reform."

Here, we used regression analyses to quantify decadal trends in length and age at maturity in ten datasets from commercial harvests, weirs, and spawner abundance surveys of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha throughout Alaska. We found that on average these fish have become smaller over the past 30 years (similar to 6 generations), because of a decline in the predominant age at maturity and because of a decrease in age-specific length. The proportion of older and larger 4-ocean age fish in the population declined significantly (P < 0.05) in all stocks examined by return year or brood year. Our analyses also indicated that the age-specific lengths of 4-ocean fish (9 of 10 stocks) and of 3-ocean fish (5 of 10 stocks) have declined significantly (P < 0.05). Size-selective harvest may be driving earlier maturation and declines in size, but the evidence is not conclusive, and additional factors, such as ocean conditions or competitive interactions with other species of salmon, may also be responsible. Regardless of the cause, these wide-spread phenotypic shifts influence fecundity and population abundance, and ultimately may put populations and associated fisheries at risk of decline."

We evaluated a large three-generation pedigree of an artificially supplemented salmon population, and found that the fish with the highest reproductive success in captivity produce early maturing male offspring that have lower than average reproductive success in the wild. In contrast to an earlier study of steelhead trout, we found little evidence that parental origin of the captive spawners influenced the subsequent reproductive success of their naturally spawning progeny."

Hypothesis tests are described to rank hypotheses and determine the size of a multiple covariate model.

Results can be directly applied to evaluate trade-offs among alternative management decisions. The methods and results are also broadly applicable outside. sheries stock assessment. We show that multiple factors influence populations and that analysis of factors in isolation can be misleading. We illustrate the framework by applying it to Pacific herring of Prince William Sound, Alaska ( USA). The Pacific herring stock that spawns in Prince William Sound is a stock that has collapsed, but there are several competing or alternative hypotheses to account for the initial collapse and subsequent lack of recovery. Factors failing the initial screening tests for statistical significance included indicators of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, coho salmon predation, sea lion predation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Northern Oscillation Index, and effects of containment in the herring egg-on-kelp pound fishery. The overall results indicate that the most statistically significant factors related to the lack of recovery of the herring stock involve competition or predation by juvenile hatchery pink salmon on herring juveniles. Secondary factors identified in the analysis were poor nutrition in the winter, ocean (Gulf of Alaska) temperature in the winter, the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and the pathogen Ichthyophonus hoferi. The implication of this result to. sheries management in Prince William Sound is that it may well be difficult to simultaneously increase the production of pink salmon and maintain a viable Pacific herring fishery. The impact can be extended to other commercially important. sheries, and a whole ecosystem approach may be needed to evaluate the costs and benefits of salmon hatcheries."

Under the assumption of no further habitat destruction, the population is predicted to have a greater than 95% probability of persistence for 200 years.

A key element of conservation planning is the extremely challenging task of estimating the likely effect of restoration actions on population status. To compare the relative benefits of typical habitat restoration actions on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), we modelled the response of an endangered Columbia River Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) population to changes in habitat characteristics either targeted for restoration or with the potential to be degraded. 2. We applied a spatially explicit, multiple life stage, Beverton-Holt model to evaluate how a set of habitat variables with an empirical influence on spring-run Chinook salmon survivorship influenced fish population abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity. Using habitat condition scenarios - historical conditions and future conditions with restoration, no restoration, and degradation - we asked the following questions: (i) how is population status affected by alternative scenarios of habitat change, (ii) which individual habitat characteristics have the potential to substantially influence population status and (iii) which life stages have the largest impact on population status? 3. The difference in population abundance and productivities resulting from changes in modelled habitat variables from the 'historical' to 'current' scenarios suggests that there is substantial potential for improving population status. Planned restoration actions directed toward modelled variables, however, produced only modest improvements. 4. The model predicted that population status could be improved by additional restoration efforts directed toward further reductions in the percentage of fine sediments in the streambed, a factor that has a large influence on egg survival. Actions reducing fines were predicted to be especially effective outside the national forest that covers most of the basin. Scenarios that increased capacity by opening access to habitat in good condition also had a positive but smaller effect on spawner numbers. 5. Degradation in habitat quality, particularly in percent fine sediments, within stream reaches located in the national forest had great potential to further reduce this population's viability. This finding supports current forest planning efforts to minimise road density and clear-cut harvests and to return forest stand structure in dry regions to the historical condition that promoted frequent low-intensity fires rather than catastrophic stand-replacing fires, as these landscape factors have been shown to influence percent fine sediment in streams. 6. Together, these results suggest that planning focusing on protecting currently good habitat, reducing fine sediments to promote egg survival and increasing spawner capacity will be beneficial to endangered spring-run Chinook population status."

Here, we model phenotypic evolution in the integrated population to investigate the effects on natural spawning fitness at the joint selection and demographic equilibrium. We find a potential, but not a certainty, depending on quantitative aspects of the management interacting with biological characteristics of the stock, for substantial erosion of natural spawning fitness, compared with the original wild population, including the possibility of runaway selection driving natural spawning fitness effectively to zero. The vulnerability to such evolutionary deterioration increases with the magnitude of the contribution of hatchery breeding to the total production and increases with harvest. The response of the selection equilibrium to increasing contribution of hatchery progeny to the broodstock can exhibit a catastrophic discontinuity."

Our study tested the hypothesis that learned predator recognition in hatchery-reared fish is favoured at ecologically appropriate periods during ontogeny. We began by asking whether the innate response of Atlantic salmon to predator odour (from high- and low-risk predators) declines during hatchery rearing. Next, we used classical conditioning to assess the capacity of fish in different age groups to learn to recognize predator odour. The first experiment showed that innate predator recognition is retained by fish for at least 8 months in a hatchery environment. However, the response of 10- to 15-week-old salmon to predator odour was significantly greater than that of younger (3-week-old) or older (28- to 36-week-old). fish. This is consistent with a period of heightened receptivity to predator odour cues. The second experiment provided evidence for age-dependent learning because salmon aged 16-20 weeks showed learned predator recognition abilities, whereas 3-week-old fish relied on innate responses. The onset of learning occurred at the age when wild fish undergo a habitat shift that greatly increases their encounters with predators. Future attempts to improve predator recognition skills of fish should take greater account of life history and focus on the ontogenetic stage where learning is favoured.
